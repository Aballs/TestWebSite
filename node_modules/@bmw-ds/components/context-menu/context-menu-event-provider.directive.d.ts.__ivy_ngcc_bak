 The eventProvider directive can be used on a bmw-context-menu in order to be notified of item selection.
 Adding this directive allows you to subscribe to the "itemSelected" event, which is emitted whenever any
 of the underlying bmw-context-menu-items is selected - regardless whether they are direct children
 or nested in bmw-context-menu components further down the tree. In most cases, you will be interested in all selectable items, so put this on your top-level
 bmw-context-menu.
